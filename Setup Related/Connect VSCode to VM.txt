If you're using password-based authentication, you'll need to enter your password each time you connect to the VM via SSH from VSCode. Here's a step-by-step guide to connect VSCode to your Debian VM using the SSH configuration you provided:

1. **Install VSCode and Necessary Extensions**:
   - If you haven't already, [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).
   - Open VSCode.
   - Go to the Extensions view by clicking on the square icon on the sidebar or pressing `Ctrl+Shift+X`.
   - Search for and install the "Remote - SSH" extension.

2. **Open the Remote-SSH Extension**:
   - Click on the green/blue bottom-left corner icon in VSCode (this is the Remote-SSH icon). Alternatively, you can use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and search for "Remote-SSH: Connect to Host".

3. **Connect to Your VM**:
	If the host already exists:
   - From the list of available hosts, select the VM you want to connect to.
   - You'll be prompted to enter the password for the user. Enter the password and press Enter.
   - If this is your first time connecting to the VM from your current machine, you might see a message about the authenticity of the host. Confirm that you want to continue connecting.
	If the host is new:
	- Click 'Add new SSH host'
	- Enter: ssh [username]@[host_ip]
		e.g ssh username@999.999.1.11
	(To get the host_ip, you can run this command: ip a | grep inet | grep global)
	- Enter the password and you should be connected. You can click 'Open Folder' on VSCode to access all the VM files

4. **Start Working on the VM**:
   - Once connected, a new VSCode window will open. This window is now connected to your VM.
   - You can open folders, edit files, and run terminals directly on the VM from this VSCode instance.
   - To open a directory, go to the File menu and select "Open Folder". Navigate to the directory you want to work in and select it.

5. **Disconnect from the VM**:
   - To disconnect from the VM, click on the green Remote-SSH icon in the bottom-left corner of the VSCode window.
   - From the dropdown menu, select "Close Remote Connection".
   - Alternatively, you can simply close the remote VSCode window to disconnect.

Remember, each time you connect to the VM using this method, you'll need to enter your password. If you connect frequently, consider setting up key-based authentication for convenience.
